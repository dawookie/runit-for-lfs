runit-for-slackware        Installation Notes               December 2, 2014
============================================================================

Runit-for-Slackware is a custom project designed to effectively replacing the
aged sysvinit package without destroying heavy levels of compatibility with
the existing Slackware init system service scripts. Although services may be
migrated into Runit service run files, this option is left entirely to the
system administrator.

Changes Made By Installing runit-for-slackware
----------------------------------------------
Installing Runit and runit-for-slackware into a Slackware system will make
some small changes to the system. The components of SysVinit will be removed.

The SysVinit components that will be removed include init, halt, shutdown,
runlevel, killall5, fstab-decode, bootlogd, poweroff, telinit, reboot, and man
pages associated with those.

The existing Slackware service scripts will be reused until further notice. This
project aims to keep traditional init scripts viable until enough can be done to
complete a transition if ever desired.

Where needed by Runit, custom replacements for many of these removed components
will be installed by Runit and runit-for-slackware.

It is possible to revert back to SysVinit after installing Runit and
runit-for-slackware by removing the runit-for-slackware package through pkgtools
and reinstalling the sysvinit packages.

Install Runit
-------------
1. Download a copy of Runit from the Runit homepage...

  http://smarden.org/runit/runit-2.1.2.tar.gz

  Or use git to checkout a copy...

  git clone http://smarden.org/git/runit.git

2. Unpack the Runit tarball in a suitable build directory such as /sources in a
typical LFS system. The Runit tarball will unpack to a new subdirectory named
"admin"...

tar xf runit-2.1.2.tar.gz
cd admin/runit-2.1.2

3. Now build the package...

package/compile
  
4. As root, install the software...

cd command
install -v runit runit-init /sbin
install -v runsvdir runsv chpst svlogd sv /usr/bin
install -v runsvchdir utmpset /usr/sbin
cp -v ../man/* /usr/share/man/man8
ln -svf /sbin/runit-init /sbin/init
mkdir -pv /etc/sv
mkdir -pv /etc/runit/runsvdir/single
mkdir -pv /etc/runit/runsvdir/multi
  

Install runit-for-lfs
---------------------
1. Unpack the runit-for-lfs tarball in a suitable build directory such as
/sources in a typical LFS system. The runit-for-lfs tarball will unpack to a
new directory named "runit-for-lfs"...

tar xf runit-for-slackware-<version>.tar.bz2
cd runit-for-slackware

2. Build and install the software. As root...

make && make install

Reboot
------
At this point, the SysVinit software have been removed, and Runit has been
installed and configured to be the new init system. However, the original init
program is still running, but the executables to signal init to reboot or shutdown
no longer exist. A simple script named "post_install_reboot" is included in the
runit-for-slackware build directory to safely halt the system and perform a low-level
reboot. To run this script, log out of X Windows to a tty console prompt, and as
root...

   NOTE: Skip this section if the installations were done in a chroot
   environment. Instead, exit chroot, unmount the virtual kernel file
   systems, and reboot the host system in its usual way.

post_install_reboot


What Now?
---------
Hopefully your system successfully reboots like it did before. Console
messaging content and appearance will be different, but it should boot as normal.
