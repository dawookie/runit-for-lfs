Thanks for downloading our project and using Runit as your init of choice
for LinuxFromScratch. A lot of hard work has gone into this project since
it's original inception on the LinuxQuestions forums as a way to import a
new and fresh init and service management system into LinuxFromScratch.

We've accomplished a lot thanks to many people who donated and allowed us
to use code and gave support. Thanks to many people we are at our first
official release as of 8-21-2014.

This imeplementation comprises of:

RTM Release - 20140821

- Complete rewrite of the Stage scripts using the method of Arch Ignite
  monolithic bootscript design. We originally used the bazzar style with
  external scripts, but found a single script was easier to maintain and
  overtly debug in the end.
  
- Our scripts have officially deprecated a lot of the old init works from
  the LFS-bootscripts and blfs-bootscripts that used the sysv init-functions
  file. This includes rc.site, init-functions, createfiles, udev_retry, and
  a few others, but the deprecation was minimal. Most of the setup done by
  rc.site is now in /etc/runit.conf.
  
- We also include a makeshift rc.local script to launch any legacy scripts
  and services prior to the services loading within Stage 2. Because runit
  is backwards compatible with system v scripting, we can effectively use
  legacy scripts and handlers to launch services. Do take in mind any
  references to init-functions used by sysvinit will have to be removed and
  replaced. It's best to just use the command path with an echo message to
  launch a service. As more runscripts become available, you may need this
  file less and less.
  
- The package is centered around the release of Runit 2.1.1 or later versions.

- We also have reimplemented several utilities donated to various Runit using
  distributions to perform sysv-like clones of shutdown, halt, and suspend.
  These files should assist greatly in compatibility with Desktop Environments
  and Window Managers.
  
- By default our system comes with two runlevels Single (for admin purposes only),
  and Multi (for general usage). You are free to add how many runlevels you like
  to Runit. For more information on that, visit: http://smarden.org/runit/runlevels.html
  and read Gerrit Pape's documentation.
  
- Our Stage 1 script supports far more than the typical LFS bootscript package
  and includes support for BtrFS partitions, network file systems, CGroups, and
  various other out of the oridinary support vectors usually found on big name
  distributions.
  
Thank you all for your support, and well wishes in our endeavour.
