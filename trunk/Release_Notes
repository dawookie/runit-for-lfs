Thanks for downloading our project and using Runit as your init of choice
for Linux From Scratch. A lot of hard work has gone into this project since
its original inception on the LinuxQuestions forums as a way to import a
new and fresh init and service management system into Linux From Scratch.

We've accomplished a lot thanks to many people who donated and allowed us
to use code and gave support. Thanks to many people we are at our first
official release as of 8-29-2014.

This implementation is comprised of:

RTM Release - 20140904

- Fixed a flag in the Makefile which caused the services in /etc/sv to not
  allow symlinks. Symlinking should now work as intended.
- Removed redundant udev_retry from Stage 1 script. Command was succeeded
  by the runit.conf MODULES section and is not required.
- Added VirtualBox Service (VBoxService) run service file from VoidLinux.
- Added Virtuoso Service run and log service files.
  
If you still have the original service files from a previous version, run
make uninstall-true in chroot to remove them.
