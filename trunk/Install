Installation of Runit

====================================================================================

First download a copy of Runit from the Runit homepage here:

  http://smarden.org/runit/runit-2.1.1.tar.gz

Or use git to checkout a copy:

  git clone http://smarden.org/git/runit.git
  
Unpack the sources as you would any other source package and the change directory to
the Runit directory in the package as such:

  cd admin/runit-2.1.1

Now we'll build the package using this command:

  package/compile
  
This will build all the relevant software and manpages. Now while in the runit-2.1.1
base directory, we'll install Runit into the system:

  cd command
  install runit runit-init /sbin
  install runsvdir runsv chpst svlogd sv /usr/bin
  install runsvchdir utmpset /usr/sbin
  cp ../man/* /usr/share/man/man8
  ln -s /sbin/runit-init /sbin/init
  mkdir -pv /etc/sv
  mkdir -pv /etc/runit/runsvdir/single
  mkdir -pv /etc/runit/runsvdir/multi
  
This should install all files to the proper locations.
