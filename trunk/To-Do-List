[ ] - Fix shutdown script to handle 'now' as 'timer = 0' when executing the timer flag
      when halting the system. This should execute as +0 rather than now, though a work
      around may be needed to call for now.

[!] - Shutdown should now work through multi-mode rather than single. This needs testing.
      If shutdown does work without single user mode enabled, sulogin service will be
      removed from the project along with ttyS0 as it serves no purpose. These were
      leftovers from VoidLinux, and shouldn't even be needed.
      
[ ] - Create/Import run service files for the following services:
          [x] - dovecot
          [x] - haveged
          [x] - iptables-ipv4
          [ ] - iptables-ipv6
          [x] - krb5
          [x] - lxdm
          [ ] - netfs (testing)
          [ ] - nfs-client (testing)
          [ ] - nfs-server (testing)
          [ ] - php-frm
          [x] - qpopper & qpopper-ssl
          [ ] - rsyncd (testing)
          [ ] - saslauthd
          [ ] - sendmail
          [x] - slapd
          [x] - soprano
          [ ] - stunnel
          [x] - svn
          [ ] - swat
          [ ] - sysstat
          [x] - virtuoso
          [x] - vsftpd
          [ ] - winbindd
          
[ ] - Create/Import any service run files not in forementioned list that could be useful
      by BLFS. [low priority]
      
[ ] - Readd BLFS service install/uninstalltion back to the Makefile to create and remove
      symlinks and execution permissions. (work in progress)

These services will be added to the project on a case-by-case basis ONLY. If you need a
script for these services, please file in the bug reports section that you need a script
for a service listed here, and we will work on getting a service run file drafted. If
you have a working script, and would like it published, you can submit it as well, and
you will be given credit for it.
