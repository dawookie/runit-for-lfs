[ ] - Create directory check and creation triggers for logging run files. For the initial
      system we used a script to auto-create the directories upon install. This could also
      be done via the Makefile.
[ ] - Create/Import run service files for the following services:
          [ ] - dovecot
          [ ] - haveged
          [ ] - heimdal
          [ ] - iptables-ipv4
          [ ] - iptables-ipv6
          [ ] - krb5
          [ ] - netfs
          [ ] - nfs-client
          [ ] - nfs-server
          [ ] - qpopper
          [ ] - rsyncd
          [ ] - saslauthd
          [ ] - sendmail
          [ ] - slapd
          [ ] - soprano
          [ ] - stunnel
          [ ] - svn
          [ ] - swat
          [ ] - sysstat
          [ ] - virtuoso
          [ ] - vsftpd
          [ ] - winbindd
[ ] - Clean up pid files to move system services into dedicated pipes.
[ ] - Create/Import any service run files not in forementioned list that could be useful
      by BLFS.
[ ] - Rewrite Makefile into separated scripts:
	install.sh
	build.sh
	remove.sh
[ ] - Fix Networking table up for error handling.
[ ] - Add CleanFS handler to stage-1.
[ ] - Check rc.site file for needed cutomizations.
[ ] - Add msg_fail and msg_ok triggers as needed.
[x] - Add Stage 3 Network Shutdown section.
[ ] - Thoroughly test Makefile. Several "install" paths accidentally were not working.
[ ] - Remove all required instances of reference and usage of /lib/lsb/init-functions. This
      was left over from sysvinit and isn't needed by Runit.
[x] - Remove sulogin service. This service is pointless for our implementation and only
      introduces a further headache on the system by forcing the user to login multiple times
      and it makes job control in the shell unusable.
[ ] - Thoroughly check each service run file for errors. Currently on some systems used for
      testing and development, service sshd refuses to start properly, and stay in the "up"
      status.
      
Flagged for deletion:

The following files are deprecated and do not need to be included and are going to be expunged
during the next cycle I'm accessing the SVN directly.

[x] modules - Was determined it was unnecessary.
[ ] init-functions - Was a hold over from sysvinit. No longer needed and scripts requiring
    function calls to are are now removed and edited.
[x] blfs-services/pppoe and pppoe lsb script - The BLFS project removed them a long time ago
    and the maintainers have said they were up to be removed as well.
[x] blfs-services ipx lsb script - BLFS project removed this as well. Considering how old
    IPX is as a protocol, I'm not surprised as barely anything would even begin to use it
    any longer.
[x] services/sulogin - After testing, I determined this script was pointless. sulogin is
    already handled by the system as it is. The service run files are redundant, and break
    the shell job control functions.
