These services will be added to the project on a case-by-case basis ONLY. If you need a
script for these services, please file in the bug reports section that you need a script
for a service listed here, and we will work on getting a service run file drafted. If
you have a working script, and would like it published, you can submit it as well, and
you will be given credit for it.
