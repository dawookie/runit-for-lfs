[ ] - Create directory check and creation triggers for logging run files. For the initial
      system we used a script to auto-create the directories upon install. This could also
      be done via the Makefile.
[ ] - Create/Import run service files for the following services:
          [ ] - dovecot
          [ ] - haveged
          [ ] - heimdal
          [ ] - iptables-ipv4
          [ ] - iptables-ipv6
          [ ] - krb5
          [ ] - netfs
          [ ] - nfs-client
          [ ] - nfs-server
          [ ] - qpopper
          [ ] - rsyncd
          [ ] - saslauthd
          [ ] - sendmail
          [ ] - slapd
          [ ] - soprano
          [ ] - stunnel
          [ ] - svn
          [ ] - swat
          [ ] - sysstat
          [ ] - virtuoso
          [ ] - vsftpd
          [ ] - winbindd
[ ] - Clean up pid files to move system services into dedicated pipes.
[ ] - Create/Import any service run files not in forementioned list that could be useful
      by BLFS.
[ ] - Clean up Makefile as/if necessary. (WIP)
[ ] - Fix Networking table up for error handling.
[ ] - Add CleanFS handler to stage-1.
[ ] - Check rc.site file for needed cutomizations.
[ ] - Add msg_fail and msg_ok triggers as needed.
[x] - Add Stage 3 Network Shutdown section.
[ ] - Thoroughly test Makefile. Several "install" paths accidentally were not working.
[ ] - Remove all required instances of reference and usage of /lib/lsb/init-functions. This
      was left over from sysvinit and isn't needed by Runit.
[ ] - Remove sulogin service. This service is pointless for our implementation and only
      introduces a further headache on the system by forcing the user to login multiple times
      and it makes job control in the shell unusable.
[ ] - Thoroughly check each service run file for errors. Currently on some systems used for
      testing and development, service sshd refuses to start properly, and stay in the "up"
      status.
