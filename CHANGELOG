Pending - Next release cycle

- Segregated lfs and blfs service files. Redrafted Makefile for the
  blfs-servicescripts to mimic functions of blfs-bootscripts for system v.
- Cache Update service. This service is a multi-use service that can be run
  either as a one shot or continuously in the background. See the cache-update
  run file for an explaination.
- Removed sulogin service. Was found to be unneeded.
- Temporary fix for shutdown. Not sure why sulogin is misbehaving but it is.
  The new fix should work without it, and call the halt without using single
  user mode.
- Uploaded several new services.
- Fixed ctrlaltdel handler for rebooting.

20140904 - Bug fix release

- Fixed a flag in the Makefile which caused the services in /etc/sv to not
  allow symlinks. Symlinking should now work as intended.

  by the runit.conf MODULES section and is not required.
- Added VirtualBox Service (VBoxService) run service file from VoidLinux.
- Added Virtuoso Service run and log service files.
