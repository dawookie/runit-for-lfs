Release 1.0rc1 - 20140922 - Release Candidate 1

- Removed several unneeded finish scripts as they only removed PID files in
  the /run directory which is cleaned on shutdown of the system anyways.
- Changed out the update-cache pause command for a timed rerun command using
  sleep instead. The cache will update every hour upon boot, and can be tuned
  by the admin for longer wait times if necessary.
- Fixed several daemons path and flags for execution states. This should allow
  some of the daemons not running properly to execute as intended, and stay in
  the "up" status rather than down.
- Completed migration of services to Runit.
- Added legacy support for haldaemon. The haldaemon run script comes with a
  special preloaded source tarball specifically for BLFS systems, but does
  require a special rebuild of D-Bus to support this feature. Instructions
  can be found in the run file header and the haldaemon-lfs.tar source package.
- Added new simplified installation format for blfs-servicescripts for
  Makefile. Commands are more simplified but should work without a problem.
- Segregated lfs and blfs service files. Redrafted Makefile for the
  blfs-servicescripts to mimic functions of blfs-bootscripts for system v.
- Cache Update service. This service is a multi-use service that can be run
  either as a one shot or continuously in the background. See the cache-update
  run file for an explaination.
- Removed sulogin service. Was found to be unneeded.
- Temporary fix for shutdown. Not sure why sulogin is misbehaving but it is.
  The new fix should work without it, and call the halt without using single
  user mode.
- Uploaded several new services.
- Fixed ctrlaltdel handler for rebooting.

20140904 - Bug fix release

- Fixed a flag in the Makefile which caused the services in /etc/sv to not
  allow symlinks. Symlinking should now work as intended.
- Removed redundant udev_retry from Stage 1 script. Command was succeeded
  by the runit.conf MODULES section and is not required.
- Added VirtualBox Service (VBoxService) run service file from VoidLinux.
- Added Virtuoso Service run and log service files.

20140830 - Bug fix release.

- Reverted log run files to /path/to method due to the fact group and
  user "log" may not exist in the system.

20140829 - Initial release of Runit-for-LFS.

- New consolidated and centralized init boot scripts.
- Legacy support through rc.local for sysv scripts and non-Runit
  covered BLFS services.
- New runit.conf system configuration file. Replaces functionality of
  rc.site, createfiles, udev_retry, and other files from LFS-Bootscripts.
- New run scripts for many services.
- Modified LSB service boot scripts for BLFS services.
- Services requiring logs have log services included.
- Simplified single and multi runlevels for basic usage.
- Imported and modified shutdown script from VoidLinux.
- Imported and modified halt binary from VoidLinux to mimic sysvinit.
- Support for Runit 2.1.1 or later.
