#summary Introduction to runit-for-lfs.

= Welcome =

Welcome to the runit-for-lfs project. Our goal for this project is to provide a new init and service management system for [http://www.linuxfromscratch.com Linux From Scratch] without the need for extra, rebuilt, and intrusive software such as that of [http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/ systemd]. We understand [http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/sysvinit sysvinit] needs a successor, but not a replacement.

In this wiki, you'll find lots of information on:

 * Deployment tactics for service supervision.
 * How-tos write service run, finish, and log scripts.
 * Helpful hints for deployment.
 * Resolving dependencies.

This wiki will expand and change as needed to provide more, and if necessary, better information.
