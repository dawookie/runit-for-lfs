Due to a lingering bug in sysvinit, this project aims to minimally introduce Runit into Slackware
Linux without replacing the majority of the system fundamentals and bootscripts and reuse, as much
as possible, the original Slackware service and bootscripts, while replacing the sysvinit package
solely with the aspect of toolkits, udev service control, and various other minor scriptworks.
